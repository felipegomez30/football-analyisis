# Big 5 European Leagues Player Analysis

Welcome to the Big 5 European Leagues Player Analysis project! This project combines web scraping, data analysis, and web development to provide insights into football players from the top European leagues. The goal of this project is to enable users to explore player statistics, compare performance metrics, and analyze player clusters based on their positions and playing styles.

The project utilizes various technologies and techniques to collect, analyze, and visualize player data. It starts with web scraping to gather player information from sources like fbref.com. The collected data includes details such as player names, ages, positions, wages and performance statistics.

Next, the data goes through a comprehensive data analysis process. Data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis are performed using the powerful pandas library. This step involves handling missing values, transforming data types, and extracting meaningful insights from the dataset. Clustering algorithms, like K-means clustering (unsupervised learning), are applied to group players based on their positions and performance attributes.

To present the analysis findings in an interactive and user-friendly manner, a web application is developed using the Dash framework. The application allows users to search for players, view their detailed statistics, and explore player clusters through insightful visualizations. The user interface features input fields, buttons, tables, graphs, and images to enhance the overall user experience.

Finally, the application is deployed on the web, enabling users to access it through their web browsers. The deployed application provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with player data and gain valuable insights into the performance and characteristics of football players from the Big 5 European Leagues.

This project serves as a testament to the power of web scraping, data analysis, and web development in extracting valuable insights from sports data. It showcases the integration of multiple technologies and methodologies to deliver a comprehensive and interactive solution for analyzing football player data.

Whether you're a football enthusiast, a data science enthusiast, or simply curious about player analysis, this project offers an engaging and informative exploration of the Big 5 European Leagues' football landscape. Enjoy the journey of uncovering the stories behind the numbers and discovering the patterns that shape the beautiful game!
